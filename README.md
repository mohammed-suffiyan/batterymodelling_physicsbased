This is my repository of physics based battery modelling

The repository will contain all the Li ion cell chemistries- predominantly NMC and LFP

The analysis will be focused mostly on degradation, fast charging and digital twin of cell

Upcoming projects will be battery level analysis on degradation, fast charging and digital twin
